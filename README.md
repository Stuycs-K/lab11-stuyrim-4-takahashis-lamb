## Adventurer Subclasses

### King

* The king holds a trident, and it's special feature is using harnested energy from the sun. 

* **Attack:** The king stabs the opponent using his sharp trident. This decreases the sun energy by 4, the king's HP by 1, and the opponent by 7 HP.
* **Special Attack:** The king uses his stored sun energy and converts it into electric energy. He initiates a lightning blast, which decreases the sun energy by 20, the king's HP by 3, and the opponent by 15 HP.
* **Support:** The king can harnest the sun's energy and heal himself. Increases player's HP by 5, and if used on a king, increases sun energy by 10.
* **Max HP:** 50 HP

### Farmer

* The farmer's special features are their berries.

* **Attack:** The farmer can use their berries to poison their opponent. This decreases the berries by 2, the farmer's hp by 2, and the opponent by 4.

* **Special Attack:** The farmer can convert multiple poison berries into a 
bomb that could potentially kill players. This decreases the farmer's berries by 7, the farmer's hp by 5, and the opponent by 10.

* **Support:** The farmer also has berries that can be used to restore health with the seeds growing other berries. This increases the player's hp by 3, and if used on a farmer, increases the berries amount by 6.
* **Max HP:** 30 HP
