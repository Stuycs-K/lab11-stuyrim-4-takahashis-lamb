## Adventurer Subclasses

### Farmer

* The farmer's special features are their berries.

* Attack: The farmer can use their berries to poison their opponent. This decreases the berries by 2, the farmer's hp by 2, and the opponent by 13.

* Special Attack: The farmer can convert multiple poison berries into a 
bomb that could potentially kill players. This decreases the farmer's berries by 7, the farmer's hp by 5, and the opponent by 25.

* Support: The farmer also has berries that can be used to restore health with the seeds growing other berries. This increases the player's hp by 9, and if used on a farmer, increases the berries amount by 6.
